# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository overview

This repository is the special `KDA-sparkle/KDA-sparkle` profile repository that powers the GitHub profile page. It primarily contains:

- The profile `README.md`, which renders on the GitHub profile.
- Generated visual assets (SVGs/GIF) used by the README.
- GitHub Actions workflows that periodically regenerate those assets.

There is no traditional application code here (no package manager, build system, or test suite). Most work in this repo involves editing Markdown, SVG, and workflow YAML files.

## Key files and generated assets

- `README.md`
  - Main profile content, including sections for "YANDERE MODE", contribution snake animation, metrics, stats, and external links.
  - References assets via `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs pointing to files in this repository.

- Root-level SVG assets:
  - `github-contribution-grid-snake.svg` – contribution graph snake animation used in the README.
  - `github-metrics.svg` – profile metrics card generated by the metrics workflow.
  - `yandere-glitch-text.svg` – glitch-style "YANDERE MODE ACTIVATED" SVG generated by the yandere workflow.

- `dist/`
  - Contains additional generated snake assets:
    - `github-contribution-grid-snake.svg`
    - `github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg`
    - `github-snake.gif`
  - These are produced by the snake workflow and published to the `output` branch via GitHub Pages.

Treat the assets above as generated output. If you modify them manually, your changes may be overwritten by the next workflow run.

## GitHub Actions workflows

All automation lives under `.github/workflows/` and runs on GitHub's infrastructure, not locally.

### `metrics.yml` – GitHub metrics card

- Uses [`lowlighter/metrics@latest`](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics).
- Triggers:
  - On schedule: `0 */12 * * *` (every 12 hours).
  - On `push` to `main`.
  - On manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Key configuration:
  - `user: KDA-sparkle`.
  - Generates `github-metrics.svg` in the repository root.
  - Enables languages, isocalendar, and stars plugins with a limited set of repositories.
- Uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for API access.

### `snake.yml` – contribution snake & GitHub Pages deployment

- Uses [`Platane/snk@v3`](https://github.com/Platane/snk) to generate contribution graph animations.
- Triggers:
  - On schedule: `0 */12 * * *` (every 12 hours).
  - On `push` to `main`.
  - On manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Workflow steps (high level):
  - `actions/checkout@v3` to fetch the repo.
  - `Platane/snk@v3` generates the following into `dist/`:
    - `github-contribution-grid-snake.svg`
    - `github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg`
    - `github-snake.gif`
  - `EndBug/add-and-commit@v9` commits changes under `dist/` back to `main` with message `🐍 Generate Snake Animation`.
  - `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4` deploys `dist/` to the `output` branch for GitHub Pages.

### `yandere.yml` – Yandere glitch SVG generator

- Generates the `yandere-glitch-text.svg` asset by echoing an inline SVG definition.
- Triggers:
  - On schedule: `0 */1 * * *` (every hour).
  - On `push` to `main`.
  - On manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Uses `permissions: contents: write` and the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Steps (high level):
  - `actions/checkout@v3` (with `persist-credentials: false` to avoid auth conflicts).
  - Shell script writes the SVG content to `yandere-glitch-text.svg` in the repository root.
  - Configures git user, stages the file, and conditionally commits & pushes to `main` only if there are changes.

## Local development and common operations

There is no local build, lint, or test toolchain configured for this repository (no `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or similar). Development here is mostly about editing content and CI configuration, then relying on GitHub Actions to regenerate assets.

When working in this repo:

- **Editing profile content**
  - Modify `README.md` and push to `main` (or a feature branch, then open a PR).
  - Ensure the image paths in the README continue to point to valid files in the repo (root or `dist/`).

- **Editing workflows**
  - Update the relevant file under `.github/workflows/`:
    - `metrics.yml` for metrics configuration.
    - `snake.yml` for contribution snake behavior or outputs.
    - `yandere.yml` for the glitch SVG content or schedule.
  - After changes land on GitHub, use the **"Run workflow"** button in the Actions tab to trigger a manual run (all workflows define `workflow_dispatch`). This is the primary way to validate workflow changes.

- **Generated files and diffs**
  - Expect large or noisy diffs in SVG/GIF files when workflows run.
  - If you are reviewing changes produced by Actions, focus on the workflow YAML and README unless you are intentionally adjusting SVG output.

## Notes from README

- The README describes the author's identity, interests, and links to external profiles (website, Twitter, Twitch, LinkedIn, DeviantArt).
- It notes that many actual projects (e.g., CSS themes) live in other repositories; this repo primarily surfaces profile information and dynamic visualizations.
- Licensing for most projects is MIT, but the canonical `LICENSE` file referenced in the README is stored in another repository (`css.astolfo.fedi.agency`).
